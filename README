## Portfolio Overview

This repository demonstrates the technical implementation of production ICM close controls:

- **Data Architecture**: [`docs/ICM_Data_Flow.drawio.pdf`](docs/ICM_Data_Flow.drawio.pdf) - Pipeline design with staging layers and freeze points
- **Operational Process**: [`docs/ICM_Comp_Close_Runbook.md`](docs/ICM_Comp_Close_Runbook.md) - Close workflow, validation thresholds, reconciliation spine
- **SQL Implementation**: Queries in `close_controls/`, `validations/`, and `troubleshooting/` execute the controls defined in the runbook

See the runbook for operational context and validation logic requirements.

# ICM SQL Close Controls (DuckDB)

This repo demonstrates an operator oriented approach to incentive compensation (ICM) data integrity using SQL:
- immutable raw staging
- curated comp-period facts
- blocking validations
- close reconciliation
- dispute tracing

See docs/ICM_Comp_Close_Runbook.md for close workflow context and operational assumptions.

## What to look at
1. Close readiness summary  
   `close_controls/s02_calc_readiness_summary.sql`

2. Recon spine (SFDC → Curated → Credited)  
   `close_controls/s03_recon_spine.sql`

3. End-to-end deal trace  
   `troubleshooting/t01_trace_deal.sql`

## How to run
```sql
-- inside DuckDB CLI
.read scripts/run_demo.sql



All data is synthetic and included solely to demonstrate validation and reconciliation patterns.
